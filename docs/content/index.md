## Introduction

This repository contains the Hands On GCP code for the workshops within Closer Academy .

This repository has the following workshops:

- [Building a simple *MLOps* system in *Google Cloud Platform*](./exercises/simple_mlops/index.md).
    - By end end of it, we should be able to understand how to create resources in Google Cloud, how to use them and how to integrate them with each other.


## Setup

Use the Cloud Editor to copy this repository.

Click the Cloud Shell Icon:

Something like this should pop-up:

![setup-2](./_assets/setup-02.png)

After that, clone the git repository and change directory to the cloned repository.
In the exercises, you'll change between the Cloud Editor and the Cloud Shell.
